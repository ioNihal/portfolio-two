title: RenderCard - From My Blog Need to a Public OG API
description: How RenderCard started as a personal OG image solution and became a free URL-based API for social preview cards.

RenderCard started with a practical problem:

**I needed clean OG images for my own blog posts, fast.**

I didn't want to design every preview card manually, and I didn't want to depend on heavy tooling just to generate one image per post.

So I built a small internal generator for myself.

Then I realized this wasn't just my problem.

---

## The original need

I wanted a simple way to generate:
- Open Graph images for blog links
- Featured images for articles
- Consistent visual style across posts

At first, this was just for my own writing workflow. I would pass title and metadata, generate a card, and move on.

That alone saved time.

## From internal tool to public API

Once the core worked, I asked:

**Why keep this locked inside one project?**

So I turned it into a public, URL-based API where image generation happens through query parameters.

Base endpoint:
- `https://rendercard.vercel.app/api/rendercard`

Minimal usage:
- `https://rendercard.vercel.app/api/rendercard?title=Hello+World`

No dashboard. No login wall. Just a URL that returns a card image.

## What RenderCard supports

RenderCard keeps the API intentionally small:

- `title` (required)
- `description` (optional)
- `theme` (optional)
- `accent` (optional hex color)
- `date` (optional: ISO date or unix ms)

Available themes:
- `minimal`
- `centered`
- `split`
- `spotlight`
- `bordered`
- `gradient`
- `glass`
- `dark`
- `mono`
- `code`

Unknown params are ignored safely, and unknown themes fall back to `minimal`.

## Why I built it this way

I wanted RenderCard to be:
- Fast to use
- Easy to embed in any stack
- Good enough by default
- Flexible when needed

If you can construct a URL, you can generate a preview image.

That means it works well for:
- OG tags in blog pages
- Twitter/X cards
- Documentation articles
- Landing page announcements
- Internal tools that need visual previews

---

## Tech direction

RenderCard is built with:
- Next.js
- Edge Runtime

Edge execution made sense here because OG image generation is request-driven and benefits from low-latency responses globally.

The focus was reliability and speed, not complexity.

---

## What it is not

- Not a design suite
- Not a no-code editor
- Not trying to replace full creative tooling

It is a focused utility: turn text and metadata into clean social preview cards.

---

## What comes next

Planned direction:
- Better typography controls
- More layout presets based on real usage
- Safer validation and clearer parameter errors
- Potential presets for blog engines

I'll keep it simple and useful first.

---

## Closing

RenderCard began as a fix for my own content workflow.

Now it's a free API others can use too.

That is usually the best kind of side project: solve one real problem well, then open it up.
