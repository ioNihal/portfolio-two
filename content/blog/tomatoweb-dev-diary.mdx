title: TomatoWeb - Building a Personal Developer Hub
description: A dev diary on why and how I built TomatoWeb as a long-term home for experiments, tools, and projects.

TomatoWeb started as a simple question:

**Where do all my side projects actually live?**

Over time, I had experiments, tools, games, and half-finished ideas scattered across repositories, subdomains, and local folders. Some were demos. Some were serious. Most didn't belong on a traditional “portfolio”.

So instead of forcing everything into one site, I decided to build a **hub**.

---

## The idea behind TomatoWeb

TomatoWeb is not a portfolio replacement.  
It's a **developer lab**.

Each project lives on its own subdomain (structural example):

- `experiments.tomatoweb.site` - UI ideas, canvas tests, visual demos  
- `games.tomatoweb.site` - indie games, mechanics experiments  
- `tools.tomatoweb.site` - utilities, dashboards, small apps  

The main site (`tomatoweb.site`) acts as a **map**, not a showcase.

This separation lets me:
- Deploy projects independently
- Break things without fear
- Treat side projects like real production apps
- Avoid “everything must be perfect” pressure

---

## Why subdomains instead of folders?

Subdomains give **psychological and technical isolation**.

Each project can have:
- Its own repository
- Its own deployment strategy
- Its own tech stack
- Its own lifecycle

If a game experiment is messy, that's fine - it doesn't pollute the rest of the system.

This mirrors how real-world systems work more than a single monolithic site.

## Tech decisions (intentionally boring)

TomatoWeb itself is intentionally simple:

- Static HTML
- Tailwind via CDN
- Minimal JavaScript
- No framework overhead
- Strong semantic HTML
- Accessibility-first decisions (skip links, proper landmarks)

The goal wasn't to show off a framework - it was to **get out of the way**.

Performance, clarity, and maintainability mattered more than novelty.

---

## Design philosophy

I wanted TomatoWeb to feel:
- Calm
- Neutral
- Slightly playful (🍅)
- Not over-designed

No dark UI experiments here.  
No heavy animations.  
No distractions.

The site should load fast, read clearly, and explain itself without trying too hard.

## Relationship with my portfolio

My **portfolio** lives at:

👉 https://ionihal.vercel.app

That's where:
- Recruiters land
- Projects are selective
- Presentation matters

TomatoWeb is different.

It's where I:
- Experiment freely
- Ship imperfect ideas
- Build systems over time
- Learn in public (quietly)

---

## What TomatoWeb is *not*

- Not a startup
- Not a product
- Not a company
- Not affiliated with anything called “Tomato Web”

It's just a **long-term personal space** for building things.

---

## Where this goes next

TomatoWeb will grow slowly.

New subdomains will appear when needed.  
Old projects may break.  
Some ideas may never be finished.

And that's exactly the point.

---

## Closing thoughts

TomatoWeb exists so I don't have to ask:

> “Is this good enough for my portfolio?”

I can just build.

And for me, that's enough.
