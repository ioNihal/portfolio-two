# Formcord Dev Diary

I started this as a tiny feature in my portfolio: a contact form that would notify me in Discord. I wanted something simple, reliable enough for a personal site, and portable across different runtimes without dragging in a heavy SDK.

That small idea kept nagging me. If I needed this, other developers probably did too. So instead of letting the code sit in one project, I decided to turn it into a standalone package anyone could reuse.

## The First Spark

The original version was a straightforward Discord REST call. It worked, but it lived inside one app. I had to re-copy the logic and tweak it every time I wanted the same behavior somewhere else. That felt wasteful.

So I asked a simple question: what if this were a clean, universal helper that anyone could install with one command?

## Turning It Into a Package

I set three rules for myself:

- Use only Web APIs like fetch, URL, and JSON
- Avoid Node-only dependencies so it works in Edge and serverless
- Keep it small, honest, and predictable

I built a core sender, then layered opinionated helpers on top: contact, error, deploy, feedback, and bug. Each helper creates a clean embed payload and sends it with minimal friction.

## The Best Part

The best part is how reusable it became. What started as a personal contact form is now a tiny tool that can plug into any app: a side project, a product launch, or even internal tooling.

I also added optional embed theming so anyone can brand their notifications without touching the core code. That made it feel complete and customizable without bloating the API.

## Shipping It

Publishing the package felt like the moment it became real. I kept it minimal, documented it clearly, and made sure it works in the runtimes I care about.

This is the kind of tool I wish I had when I started building. Now it exists, and anyone can use it.

## What's Next

- More helpers based on real use cases
- Optional adapters for other platforms
- Keep the core tiny and stable
