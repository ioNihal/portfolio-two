# Project Lyrics - Interactive Music Player Experience

*Published on: 2026-02-02*

Project Lyrics is a creative web project that lets users enjoy an immersive music listening experience right inside the browser. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, it showcases interactive design and dynamic content - making even simple song playback feel more engaging.

This project demonstrates how modern web technologies can come together to create a fun and visually appealing interface for something as universal as music.

## Features

-  **Play Icon Start:** Clicking the play icon launches the song and smoothly scrolls to the main lyrics view. 
-  **Lyric Animation:** The song lyrics are displayed with animation while the track plays.
-  **Music Controls:** Users can pause, resume, go to next or previous song, and watch the progress bar update in real time.

##  Why I Built It

I wanted to explore how dynamic user interfaces could enhance simple interactions like playing music. With Project Lyrics, I experimented with scroll-based navigation and animated content synced with audio elements - all without heavy frameworks.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** for structure  
- **CSS3** for styling and responsive layout  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for logic and interactivity  

The codebase is clean and beginner-friendly, making it a great example for anyone starting with interactive web apps.
